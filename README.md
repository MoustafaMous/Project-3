# Project-3

## Investment Advisors   

Our team has put together an algorithmic trading strategy that impliments machine learning to offer a better daily return than the market.

We also have a investor facing website to show off the results of our strategy


## Algorithm Trading Model

Our model uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning as well as moving averages.

We applied this model to two asset classes, the SPY ETF (electronically traded fund), and Bitcoin (BTC)


## Website Interface 

Using streamlit we are able to put together a website for our prospective investors

You can decide which asset you wish to look at, and look at a graph of our performance over the past year. 


## Free NFTs!

We had designs to place in a free NFT for those who used our service, we were not able to actually get that piece working. 


## Next Steps

We would like to further flesh our our strategy and increase the capabilities of our website. 

Also we would like to add future projections to extrapoliate future values

As well as the NFTs that were previously mentioned
